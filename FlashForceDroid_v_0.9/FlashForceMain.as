ISSUE TRACKER
--2/15/2011 BUG sev10 #1: brick got hit before menu went up -> menu went up and stopped brick from dying -> reset pressed on menu -> level screwed up because brick that was hit had a handle on it.  Check this out 2/15/2011
	$2/17/2011 commented out the if(!mainRef.isPaused) control in the death method of the level bricks so that they could die properly
--2/15/2011 BUG sev7 #2: brick got hit before menu went up -> menu went up and stopped brick from dying -> resume pressed on menu -> hit brick didn't die because it had a handle on it.  Bricksdestroyed never reaches full level, but when someone wins and you press start for a new game it works all right again  Check this out 2/15/2011
	$2/17/2011 commented out the if(!mainRef.isPaused) control in the death method of the level bricks so that they could die properly
--2/19/2011 BUG sev7 #3: level overlay... anyone wins with no bricks left->hit 'menu' a few times to [no effect?] while start button visible and things paused->hit start for new game->seemed to play normally at first->hit 'menu' and 'resume'->level regenerated before it was gone, and resulted in overlay 
                                    -- also happens when not hitting 'menu' before start.
									-- also happens sometimes without ever hitting menu, before or after start...  but the menu/resume combo seems to have something to do with it possibly as it caused the bug to trigger immediately when things seemed to be working otherwise
                                    --?$Try checking out the controls stopping the level from regenerating while start butto visible, and how that might relate to menu stuff?
                                    -- This seems to be potentially primarily related to hitting 'start' to restart the game before five seconds have gone by...
     $2/22/2011 Inserted a shortTimer.stop and reset command in bricks.remakeLvl.  Problem was that levelregen clock started and if start button was pressed too soon doomCount would be zero when it fired its timeerComplete event and the levelregen would occur even though remakeLvl already had restored bricks.

--2/15/2011 Feature Request #1: What exactly puts the one-at-a-time control on the bricks? 
							  --...that and only that is what needs to be interrupted when punchPower is true and restored when it is false...
     $3/8/2011 ball.hitControl was controlling the bricks one-at-a-time exploding.  I fixed a curly brace placement so that if(!ball.punchPower) was ONLY around the hit controlling section of code [stopped just before the ball.control paddle width changing operations]
2/15/2011 Wish #1: Would be good if evilPaddle turned blue or soemthing while frozen, then reverted back when unfrozen...
--2/20/2011 Feature Requirement #1: should put in if(event.target)..is the correct symbol in the listener usePower() for power-clicked mouse event.
	 $5/11/2011 done
3/1/2011  Wish #2: A visible countdown to level regeneration might be nice...
--3/4/2011  Bug Sev10 #4: Level overlay somehow... possibly related to bricks.shorttimer/levelregen being about to fire or in the process of firing when I pressed start button to restart
                       -- most likely though it has something to do with the menu and/or the resume button.  Unknown if it has anything to do with menu calling and brick hitting simultaneously again... doesn't seem so.
     $added extra control bricksHandle.numChildren == 0 to a few bricks.makeLvl calls, and ball.doomCount != 1 if bricks.timeOn was true when you hit menu->resume and someone had won [if you can even do that, which you shouldn't be able to...].  Also fixed a loophole where bricks.timeOn could be true when it shouldn't be if you hit menu and reset after all bricks were destroyed and before they regenerated [fixed by adding bricks.timeOn = false in beginAgain].
5/17/2011 Wish #3 Using CoreTween or another tweening engine to smooth the menu tween might be nice...
--5/18/2011 BUG #4 sev5: When Ball2 disappears in the area where blocks will appear a 'ghost' of it stays behind and either bricks break magically or we get the error ArgumentError: Error #2025: The supplied DisplayObject must be a child of the caller.
	at flash.display::DisplayObjectContainer/removeChild()
	at FlashForceMain/endBallMultiply()[E:\miniTD\Flash\FlashForce\FlashForceMain.as:604]
	at flash.events::EventDispatcher/dispatchEventFunction()
	at flash.events::EventDispatcher/dispatchEvent()
	at flash.utils::Timer/tick() ... possibly related to a hittestobject handle, but it happened even with no bricks present... investigate
		learned also that bricks will continue to break on ghost (usually? once it seemed that this part never happened.  
		perhaps somethign to do with the length opf time that the bircks have been gone?) along with error message until you summon another ball2.  
		After that the bricks don't break on 'nothing' but you do get the above error everytime the bricks spawn in the spot it vanished...
	$solved by adding 'death buffer' time
6/10/2011 BUG #5 sev6: Level does not remake itself if there are any blockbricks remaining when someone whens and you press start to restart.  Seems the count isn't quite getting to what selfdestruct2 wants... may happen with or without any brickblocks present or ever having been present... need to test more 
				see the output for bug 5 txt file for useful clues
12/27/2011	WISH #4: The punchPower control structure should be sensitive to who has control of the ball, such that the ball only passes through bricks when it is coming off a hit from the player's paddle 
					whho activated their punchPower (assuming the enemy is given powers evwentually).
