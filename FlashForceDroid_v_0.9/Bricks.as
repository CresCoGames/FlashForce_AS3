﻿//We want to apply a major change to this class such that one of two design possibilities is implemented:
//1. Create an entire stage full of generic display objects of brick proportions at program start. Do not add them to the display list immediately.
//As stage codes are generated, cast certain generic displayobjects to specific brick types.  When a brick is hit,
//it simply becomes invisible and inert until a level code calls for its use again later (possibly re-casting it to another brick type) or the level respawns.  
//If we go this route, object pooling may be useful.
//   Advantages: No brick-based GC at all, and no in-game load times.  Potentially simpler to handle.
//   Disadvantages: Application has a higher memory footprint overall as memory is reserved for eevry possible brick at all times.
//           this could be eased by making the invisi-bricks have tiny or no dimensions until they are cast
//			 to actual brick types.  Whenever a level changes (not respawns, but changes) the inert brick types would be cast
//			 back to tiny invisi-bricks so that as little 'inactive memory' is reserved at any given time.
//2. Dynamically create and destroy bricks as we have been doing, but only when a level changes. When bricks are hit, they simply become invisible/inert
//	 they are not made eligible for GC until the level code changes.  When this happens, all the bricks are destroyed together, and the new level
//   is created according to the new level code.
//	Advantages: Potentially a much smaller memory footprint, no 'wasted' resources.
//	Disadvantages: potentially more difficult to manage, bricks will contribute to GC runs, thereby making GC run more often.

		 *Issue with some bricks not re-drawing themselves is due to the
		 *drawRect function not liking repeated calls for some reason
		 *Initially, simply calling drawRect once and then changing size
		 *is enough, but when you wish to have new levels, thus requiring
		 *(potentially) some bricks to be rendered for the first time and
		 *others to be re-rendered in the same or a different color as
		 *brick type assignments change, things get a little sticky...
		 *
		 *UPDATE: Unit tests reveal that calling drawRect repeatedly is NOT
		 *the issue, nor is setting brick size to 0 width and 0 height
		 *before calling drawRect-- in each of those cases alone the
		 *brick re-rendered itself.
		 *The problem lies in the combination of simple 're-inflating' of the
		 *brick (e.g. IB.width = 55) and calling drawRect
		 *
		 *UPDATE2: drawRect shouldn't create a new rectangle object each call;
		 *that was for BitmapData.rect, which returns a rectangle object
		 *
		 *UPDATE3: it now appears the problem is related to the collision of 
		 *functions called by the startButton click-- each IB calls selfDestruct
		 *while Bricks simulataneously calls genLevel!
		 *
		 *UPDATE4: turns out we already call setInert on all active levelMembers inside Bricks.genLevel()
		 *so we disabled the selfDestruct function (by commenting the addWired... function which
		 *ties the bricks to the startbutton
		 *
		 *&*^*&^&*^*(& Though Unitbrick seemed fine with repeated calls to drawRect,
		 *IB immediately fails to re-render in any case when given drawRect repeatedly.
		 *When given the old first drawRect, then expand size approach, it will 
		 *re-render on gnuSystemRemakeLvl but not on genLevel.  It is notable that
		 *the IB objects ARE being activated on genLevel, just not rendered...
		 *
		 *UPDATE5: Okay, reset the isInit checks to be individual fields
		 *on each IB and now rendering and re-rendering work in all 
		 *conditions... this leaves the problem of changing brick colors
		 *to match behaviors however, but at least we basically know what
		 *is going on now.
